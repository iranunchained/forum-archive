This grant is for a generic pool of funds that will be used at the discretion of the IranUnchained DAO to retroactively reward individuals & groups who have made meaningful contributions towards Iranian Freedom, especially those that donâ€™t fit neatly into other grant proposals. 

We are open to discussion about high impact uses for these funds - please comment below with suggestions & nominations for retroactive funding.
