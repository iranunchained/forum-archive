# IranUnchained NGO


We explain how Iran Unchained is set upâ€”it uses a novel NGO and DAO hybrid structure.

The NGO points to the DAO and the DAO ratified the NGO charter through an onchain vote.

We started by proposing 5 grants as the proof of concept to understand the compliance requirements and challenges.

So far we've sent out ~$40K and it's just the beginning...

# Geek Time! ðŸ¤“

IranUnchained under the hood is a MolochDAO V3 and each grant fund is a Gnosis Safe smart contract owned by the DAO.

You can see the full workflow in the images below and the short explanation in my talk.
