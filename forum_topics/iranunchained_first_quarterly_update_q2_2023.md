# Summary of Our Grantees

## Internet4i
Our first grant for [Internet Freedom for Iran](https://forum.iranunchained.com/t/internet-freedom-for-iran/16) was awarded to [@internet4i](https://twitter.com/internet4i)!

We are proud to support activists using legal means to disrupt internet censorship on Iranians, and also groups providing censorship-resistance internet infrastructure!

We're proud of internet4i for taking an early public stand against "Arvan Cloud", a tech company assisting the Islamic Republic with Internet censorship.

Their activism & legal pressure was vindicated when the @USTreasury imposed sanctions on Arvan Cloud!

## Zan Zendegi Azadi Newsletter
Another grantee was [ZZANewspaper](https://forum.iranunchained.com/t/zan-zendegi-azadi-newsletter/12), a daily revolution newspaper operating in Iran.

Documenting the history of the #WomanLifeFreedom revolution is incredibly high stakes journalism, with the entire team operating anonymously.

Great work ✊

## Game of Trust
Last but not least, our second [Internet Freedom for Iran](https://forum.iranunchained.com/t/internet-freedom-for-iran/16) grantee was the ["Game of Trust" project](https://forum.iranunchained.com/t/game-of-trust-a-web-of-trust-between-iranian-protesters/48).

They are working on a social trust network that uses Ethereum addresses as the bedrock of a web-of-trust, which can be used to secure anonymous comms.
